# BottlesShooter-
This is a demo to interact with Oculus Go and Unity technologies, throughout the immersion in a farm in which you can shoot to bottles.

### Description

For this first approach and interaction with technologies and devices of Mixed Reality, I decided to use the Oculus Go (VR), to make a small demo in the Unity development environment and using the C # programming language.

This demo consists of shooting and throwing bottles that are distributed on a farm, in a random manner and with different organization patterns.

The controller of the Oculus Go is used to handle the weapon and in it, the PrimaryIndexTrigger, or front trigger, to be able to shoot the bullets with which they want to throw the bottles. On the other hand, with the VR glasses the environment of the farm is shown to the user, trying to achieve a better immersion both with the different graphic elements (houses, grass, birds, bottles, guns, buckets, etc.), as well as with sounds of ambience and interaction (shooting, bottle breaking)
